Hi there! I’m a third-year Ph.D. student, advised by Professor [Bilge Mutlu](http://bilgemutlu.com/).

I design **human-centered AI systems** that combine black box AI models (i.e., large language models (LLMs)) with *formal methods*—such as verification, synthesis, and Markov Decision Processes—to make AI outputs **verifiable, adaptable, and repairable**. My work tackles challenges users face when AI is deployed in real-world settings, including unreliable verification, limited adaptability, and misaligned expectations.

By integrating deterministic checks, persistent constraints, and transparent reasoning into AI workflows, I aim to reduce oversight burden, make user control more expressive, and ensure AI systems adapt smoothly to changing needs. My five research pillars—**Verify, Constrain, Observe, Adapt, and Bridge**—guide this work toward AI that is reliable, transparent, and seamlessly embedded in human workflows.

My research is supported by the [Cisco Distinguished Graduate Fellowship](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/2025-cs-department-awards-and-thank-yous/) and the [NSF INTEGRATE Research Training Program Fellowship](https://integrate.wisc.edu/).
